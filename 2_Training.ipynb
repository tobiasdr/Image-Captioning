    "## Step 1: Training Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step of the notebook, you will customize the training of your CNN-RNN model by specifying hyperparameters and setting other options that are important to the training procedure.  The values you set now will be used when training your model in **Step 2** below.\n",

    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The architecture chosen consists of a CNN that acts as an encoder and an LSTM NN that acts as a decoder. The CNN is a pretrained Res net (https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) loaded from the torchvision.models module. The RNN architecture was taken from the paper with the title: \"Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator\" that was suggested above. The paper also specified the values for the vocabulary treshold (5), the size of the embedding (512) and the LSTM memory size (512). A batch size of 64 seemed to work well. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The CNN architecture is preloaded, hence it is a standard model that was not modified. The assumption is that the transform has been adjusted to the standard model. All requirements of a transform have been met. The images are resized to 256 to ensure a standard size and then cropped to 224x224 which is the input size for the Resnet. Flipping the images increases the dataset size and normalising has been shown to improve training of neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I used the suggested list of learnable parameters. The parameters of the encoder are already optimised since the model has been pretrained with a great amount of images. The Resnet also consists of 50 layers, hence it is computationally intensive to train. To speed up the training process, only the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder are trained. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Stochastic gradient descent was proposed in the paper, however leads to slow convergence. Adam optimizer leads to better training"

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, if you would like to go above and beyond in this project, you can read about some approaches to minimizing overfitting in section 4.3.1 of [this paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7505636).  In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
